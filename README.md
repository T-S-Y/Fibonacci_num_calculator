# Fibonacci_num_calculator

1. Analysis;
The Python program 'Fibonacci_num_calculator.py' is designed according to the EVA design pattern.
It calculates the Fibonacci number of a given input 'x' using recursion.
The program generates a random integer 'x' between 0 to 20 and computes the corresponding Fibonaccinumber.

3. Input;
The program requires no user input. It internally generates a random integer 'x' within the range
of 0 to 20 to calculate the Fibonacci number.

4. Assumptions;
The program assumes 'x' to be an integer between 0 to 20 for generating the Fibonacci number.
It is designed to handle valid integer inputs within this range.

5. Processing/Algorithm;
The 'fib()' function uses recursion to calculate the Fibonacci number of 'x'.
It checks for the base cases (0 and 1) and recursively computes the Fibonacci number for
other values of 'x' until it reaches the base cases.

6. Output;
Upon execution, the program displays the generated random number 'x' and computes and prints
the corresponding Fibonacci number of 'x'.

7. Documentation;
The Python program 'Fibonacci_num_calculator.py' calculates the Fibonacci number of a randomly
generated integer 'x' between 0 to 20 using recursion.

8. Requirements;
Python interpreter 3.x or newer installed with libraries and support programs from the standard
installation available at www.python.org.
The program 'Fibonacci_num_calculator.py' can be executed either from the Python interpreter shell
or through an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IDLE or VS Code.

9. Additional Notes;
No known bugs exist in the program, and it functions as intended without unexpected behavior.
For further details on the usage and documentation, refer to the respective sections in the README.
